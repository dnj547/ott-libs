              <p>You are an otter in the Central Park Zoo. No one comes to see the otter exhibit. You feel under appreciated and unloved.
              But then one day, a group of people visit the zoo and you hear them talking about how much they love otters!
              They spend most of their time at the zoo at the otter exhibit. They’re kind of obsessive actually. But you and your otter friends love the attention.
              You finally feel like the otters are the star of the show, as you should be! But then the people start to say goodbye.
              They say they have to go back to school. You’re so sad that they’re leaving. You want them to adopt you and your otter friends.
              You wish you could just go with them back to…
              Wait a minute. They had shirts on that said “Flatiron School”… What if that’s where they live?
              Why don’t you and the otters just escape from the zoo and find Flatiron School? The people would be so happy to see you!
              You hatch a plan with your otter friends to escape from the zoo and find Flatiron School.</p>

It’s still dark outside. You go towards some bright lights in the distance, and the otters follow. When you get to the street, you notice a tall <span accesskey="noun3"></span> with a bright screen on it. It reminds you of the screens the zookeepers used to let you play with - that’s how you learned to <span accesskey="verb3"></span>. You remember seeing a map on the screen… Maybe this screen has a map, too! The otters help you reach the screen, and you eventually find the directions to Flatiron School. Each otter memorizes a section of the directions, and you start <span accesskey="verb-ing6"></span> towards the subway. It’s getting bright outside. You start seeing more people. For some reason, they all seem to be scared of otters! People are <span accesskey="verb-ing7"></span> and <span accesskey="verb-ing8"></span> when they see you! But no one’s stopping you yet. You get on the train, and it practically clears out! The only person left after the doors close is a fragrant man sleeping in the corner. Ooh, and someone left some <span accesskey="plural-snack2"></span> on the ground! You have a small feast during the ride.</p>
