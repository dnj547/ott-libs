        <li>You are an otter in the Central Park Zoo. No one comes to see the otter exhibit. You feel under appreciated and unloved.</li>
        <li>But then one day, a group of people visit the zoo and you hear them talking about how much they love otters!</li>
        <li>They spend most of their time at the zoo at the otter exhibit. They’re kind of obsessive actually. But you and your otter friends love the attention.</li>
        <li>You finally feel like the otters are the star of the show, as you should be! But then the people start to say goodbye.</li>
        <li>They say they have to go back to school. You’re so sad that they’re leaving. You want them to adopt you and your otter friends.</li>
        <li>You wish you could just go with them back to…</li>
        <li>Wait a minute. They had shirts on that said “Flatiron School”… What if that’s where they live?</li>
        <li>Why don’t you and the otters just escape from the zoo and find Flatiron School? The people would be so happy to see you!</li>
        <li>You hatch a plan with your otter friends to escape from the zoo and find Flatiron School.</li>
