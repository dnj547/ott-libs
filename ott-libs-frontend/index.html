              But then one day, a group of people visit the zoo and you hear them talking about how much they love otters!
              They spend most of their time at the zoo at the otter exhibit. They’re kind of obsessive actually. But you and your otter friends love the attention.
              You finally feel like the otters are the star of the show, as you should be! But then the people start to say goodbye.
              They say they have to go back to school. You’re so sad that they’re leaving. You want them to adopt you and your otter friends.
              You wish you could just go with them back to…
              Wait a minute. They had shirts on that said “Flatiron School”… What if that’s where they live?
              Why don’t you and the otters just escape from the zoo and find Flatiron School? The people would be so happy to see you!
              You hatch a plan with your otter friends to escape from the zoo and find Flatiron School.</p> -->

After they leave, you decide to hatch a plan with the otters to escape from the zoo and find your friends again at Flatiron School.</p>
